<h1>BlueChew Review By A Licenced Physician, John Kepler, MD</h1>
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.decipher-impact.com/bluechew-medical-review />
<p>Just tried <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://t.frtym.com/g78d5eomkg?url_id=0&aff_id=111817&offer_id=6218">BlueChew</a></strong></span> last night, and thought it might make a good addition to the blog if I did a review.  Here it goes.</p>
<p>First of all, BlueChew is a tad different to most ED pills in that it’s a <em>chewable</em> Viagra. Other than that, the process works pretty much the same when you order online as it does for any ED pill.</p>
<p>In this BlueChew review, I’m going to show you:</p>
<ol>
<li>What BlueChew did for me, including the ordering process</li>
<li>How safe the tablet is</li>
<li>The cost</li>
<li>How it compares to other ED pills</li>
</ol>
<p>But first …</p>
<h2>Why I Decided to Review BlueChew</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-972" src="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20191009_173727.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="499" srcset="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20191009_173727.jpg 374w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20191009_173727-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></p>
<p>I’ve been struggling with erectile dysfunction. I’ve just reached forty, and while I never in my life would have thought ED would ever strike me, I began to reason that my age had a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>As it turns out, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/symptoms-causes/syc-20355776">erectile dysfunction has numerous causes</a>. A man can have an underlying health condition, such as diabetes, but ED can also be caused by psychological issues. Either way, diagnosis is hard to come by because most men &#8211; like me &#8211; don’t like to see a doctor about this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I avoided the doctor and told myself it’ll be fine &#8211; my erection will come back. Perhaps I’m just low on testosterone and need to eat more beef. In the meantime, my partner decided she could no longer wait and blamed herself. She thought my ED was all down to her. In other words, I didn’t fancy her.</p>
<p>After destroying my relationship and starting a new one, I knew it was time to take action. I don’t want this new relationship to go the same way as the last one. But like most guys, I still couldn’t face seeing a doctor in person. Instead, I <a href="https://t.frtym.com/g78d5eomkg?url_id=0&aff_id=111817&offer_id=6218">learned about the BlueChew.com subscription</a> and found that it sold chewable Viagra tablets designed to get a man’s sex life back on track. I also discovered that you don’t have to see a doctor in person to get a prescription (more on that soon).</p>
<p>So I tried it out …</p>
<h2>How Bluechew Works</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-966" src="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20191009_174906.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="499" srcset="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20191009_174906.jpg 374w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20191009_174906-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></p>
<p>BlueChew is a U.S. online subscription service where men can go to get prescribed chewable Viagra tablets.. All tablets are prescribed by licensed physicians and they contain either Sildenafil or Tadalafil &#8211; the active ingredients in Viagra. What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil">Sildenafil</a>? It’s the chemical that relaxes your blood vessels. Once the blood vessels in your penis are relaxed, more blood is able to flow and this is what helps you to get a better erection.</p>
<p>There are numerous BlueChew plans available, you get access to professional medical support, and you never have to once see a doctor in person. Instead, you just fill out a few questions, get your prescription &#8211; and take your pills.</p>
<h5><strong>To sum up:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>BlueChew is a hassle-free way of getting a harder erection for men with ED</li>
<li>It’s a chewable Viagra that tastes pretty cool</li>
<li>Contains the same active ingredients as Viagra and Cialis</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at the process …</p>
<h2>How To Get BlueChew (The Process)</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1034" src="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-To-Get-BlueChew.jpg" alt="How To Get BlueChew" width="599" height="449" srcset="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-To-Get-BlueChew.jpg 1024w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-To-Get-BlueChew-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-To-Get-BlueChew-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<h4>Use <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.decipher-impact.com/go/bluechew-sample/">the coupon code CHEWGIFT</a></strong></span> to get $20 off the first month of the subscription</h4>
<p>If you think you want to give BlueChew a go, you first have to head over to the <a href="https://t.frtym.com/g78d5eomkg?url_id=0&aff_id=111817&offer_id=6218"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BlueChew.com website</strong></span></a> and fill in a few questions. I think there are 11 in total. They’re all health-related and they don’t take long to fill in at all. Are they necessary? They are in that BlueChew’s physicians want to verify that you’re actually eligible for ED pills. If the physician who takes a look at your form decides that you are eligible, they will send you an email letting you know that you’ve been approved.</p>
<p>The next step is for you to choose a BlueChew plan. There are a few to choose from and you can also get a 30-day free trial first before you make your big decision (more on that later).</p>
<p>This is how it worked for me:</p>
<p>I was approved within 24 hours</p>
<p>I chose my plan (Busy)</p>
<p>My first package arrived within 3 days</p>
<p>The box contained the tablets, as well as a safety information pack and a thank you card</p>
<p>All in all, the process was simple, quick and stress-free. I thought the thank you card was a nice touch which made me feel really at ease with the whole thing.</p>
<h2>The Chewable Viagra &#8211; Does BlueChew Work?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1035" src="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Chewable-Viagra-–-Does-BlueChew-Work.jpg" alt="The Chewable Viagra – Does BlueChew Work" width="599" height="449" srcset="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Chewable-Viagra-–-Does-BlueChew-Work.jpg 1024w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Chewable-Viagra-–-Does-BlueChew-Work-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Chewable-Viagra-–-Does-BlueChew-Work-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p>The million dollar question on the tip of everyone’s tongue is whether or not BlueChew actually works. For an ED pill to be a success it needs to get the man hard pretty quickly (within an hour is generally good), and it needs to keep the man hard for at least 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>I can be a cynic when it comes to ED pills, but what I liked initially about the BlueChew tablet is that it’s chewable. It’s also pretty small &#8211; the size of a dime &#8211; and it’s got a taste to it. I personally don’t mind swallowing pills but I know a lot of people do, so BlueChew is a handy alternative.</p>
<p>After I started chewing the pill, it took around half an hour for me to get an erection. Bear in mind that you need stimulation too, and me and my partner were starting to ‘get down to things.’ It wasn’t long, then, that my erection got rock hard &#8211; harder than it has been for a long, long time.</p>
<p>The cynic in me was surprised but it wasn’t long before I relaxed my mind completely and just enjoyed the sex. It was amazing and intense. My penis hadn’t been this sensitive for over a year and the only thing I had to worry about was getting tired (which was nothing to do with BlueChew).</p>
<p>I did come pretty quickly, but again that was nothing to do with BlueChew. That was all to do with me being over-excited and unable to believe my luck. My partner and I were having a great time. Moreover, <a href="https://t.frtym.com/g78d5eomkg?url_id=0&aff_id=111817&offer_id=6218"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BlueChew meant</strong></span></a> that I was able to go again an hour or so later. It didn’t fully leave my system for 3 hours. I was beat by then anyway, but at least I’d had round 2 &#8211; something I hadn’t had for well over 2 years. In short, I was enjoying my “honeymoon” all over again.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1037" src="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluechew.jpg" alt="bluechew" width="599" height="449" srcset="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluechew.jpg 599w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluechew-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p>What BlueChew gave me overall was really important &#8211; reassurance that I was going to get an erection. For any man who wants to enjoy a healthy sex life with his partner and who doesn’t want to let his woman down, this is key. I knew after one pill that I was going to take one the day after and have great sex again. I haven’t had that sort of confidence for so long.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>BlueChew is chewable, which means you don’t need to worry about swallowing a massive pill</li>
<li>It gets you hard within 30 minutes and keeps you hard for 2-3 hours</li>
<li>It makes your penis super sensitive, which improves sex and orgasm</li>
<li>It gives you confidence that you will perform</li>
</ul>
<h2>The BlueChew Free Trial</h2>
<p>Not sure if you want to go ahead and buy BlueChew just yet? That’s no problem because there’s a free trial available.</p>
<p>After all, buying ED pills online can be a real hassle when it turns out that the pills don’t even work. Not only are you and your partner left frustrated and disappointed, but you’ve also lost your cash.</p>
<p>The good news is that a <a href="https://t.frtym.com/g78d5eomkg?url_id=0&aff_id=111817&offer_id=6218"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BlueChew coupon code</strong></span></a> is all you need to get access to the BlueChew free trial. With your BlueChew coupon code, you get 30 days worth of pills. The only catch is that you have to cover the $5 shipping charge, which means you’ll need your card.</p>
<p>In more good news, BlueChew email you a few days before the end of your BlueChew free trial to remind you it’s coming to an end. Then, you can either choose to subscribe or cancel. My reminder email came 2 days before my trial was due to end. You can get the free trial here.</p>
<h2>How Much Does BlueChew Cost?</h2>
<p>If you’ve tried the <a href="https://t.frtym.com/g78d5eomkg?url_id=0&aff_id=111817&offer_id=6218"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BlueChew free trial</strong></span></a> and decided you want to subscribe, there are four plans available. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active &#8211; $20 a month and 6 x Sildenafil Chewables</li>
<li>Busy &#8211; $30 a month and 10 x Sildenafil Chewables</li>
<li>Popular &#8211; $50 a month and 17 x Sildenafil Chewables</li>
<li>Pro &#8211; $90 a month and 34 x Sildenafil Chewables</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to take your time before making your decision, as you don’t want to waste your cash. All plans include monthly refills and access to a digital physician. You can pick your BlueChew plan here.</p>
<h2>BlueChew Versus Other ED Pills</h2>
<p>For the sake of this review, I also tried other ED pills online to see how BlueChew compares. One of the things that marks BlueChew out from the rest is the free trial mentioned above. None of the other pills I tried &#8211; GetRoman, Hims and Pfizer &#8211; offered a free sample. For men who like to try before they buy, this can be a massive negative.</p>
<p>Not just that, but BlueChew worked faster and it worked for longer. The fact that it’s a chewable Viagra is also a massive bonus for men who don’t like swallowing big tablets.</p>
<h2>Is BlueChew Safe?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1038" src="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Is-BlueChew-Safe-.jpg" alt="Is BlueChew Safe" width="599" height="449" srcset="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Is-BlueChew-Safe-.jpg 1024w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Is-BlueChew-Safe--300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Is-BlueChew-Safe--768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p>Another big question men have when it comes to ED pills online is safe and side effects.</p>
<p>BlueChew is made in the USA so its ingredients are completely legit and it&#8217;s safe if follow your prescription. The doctors who work for them were trained by the University of Chicago medical school, and they’re all certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. They’re not a bunch of random men on the internet who have no idea what they’re talking.</p>
<p>Also, you can do research of your own, but just a quick check of the bluechew.com website should give you a hint into how legit the company is. The website is professionally done, and the support is awesome.</p>
<p>However, while BlueChew is safe and legit, there is still the possibilities that some men might <a href="https://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/en-us/viagra/fda-label">experience side effects</a>. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Muscle pain</li>
<li>Back pain</li>
<li>Upset tummy</li>
<li>Flushing</li>
</ul>
<p>What I would say is that these are side effects you can experience with any Viagra. To be on the safe side, you absolutely must not take BlueChew if you’re already taking a medicine called nitrates or if you’re allergic to Sildenafil. Even just Sildenafil 20mg will cause a reaction if you’re allergic.</p>
<h3>BlueChew Cons</h3>
<p>I was pretty happy with my BlueChew experience, but if there’s one minor strike against it, it’s that it hasn’t been approved by the FDA. The reason for this is that the prescription is for men who can’t get FDA approved treatments. Moreover, the key ingredients in BlueChew are all FDA approved, so you have nothing to worry about there.</p>
<p>Another minor con is that it’s subscription-based, which means you will need your card and you will need to be okay with paying online. However, you can cancel your account at any time or put it on hold. It’s really easy to do both those things.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1039" src="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Conclusion-bluechew.jpg" alt="Conclusion-bluechew" width="599" height="449" srcset="https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Conclusion-bluechew.jpg 599w, https://www.decipher-impact.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Conclusion-bluechew-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p>To sum up my <a href="https://t.frtym.com/g78d5eomkg?url_id=0&aff_id=111817&offer_id=6218"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BlueChew Review</strong></span></a>, I’d have to give it major thumbs up if you’re looking for a reliable, legit and effective pill for erectile dysfunction. The fact that it’s a chewable Viagra is a huge plus, as is the fact that you can use a <a href="https://t.frtym.com/g78d5eomkg?url_id=0&aff_id=111817&offer_id=6218"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BlueChew coupon code</strong></span></a> to claim a free 30-day trial. With no hassle and no doctors to see in person, you can instead focus on getting your sex life back on track.</p>
